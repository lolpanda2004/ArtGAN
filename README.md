# Abstract Art by GAN

This project is an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate abstract art. GANs are a class of machine learning models that consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously. The generator learns to generate new data samples that are similar to a training dataset, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated data.
